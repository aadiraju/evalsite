        <h3>Study Objectives</h3>
        <p class="">
            The objective of this work is to develop educational software that helps students and course administrators
            to
            automatically generate and interpret feedback from assignment submissions in a course.
        </p>
        <h3>Risks</h3>
        <p class="">
            There are no known risks to participants that as there is nothing more than what you would normally be doing
            for
            studying purposes regardless of their participation in the study.
        </p>
        <h3>Benefits</h3>
        <p class="h">
            The participants may gain a better understanding of the concepts that you practice on through the software,
            may
            develop an appreciation for learning analytics software, and may develop interest in the research and
            development
            process.
        </p>
        <h3>Privacy and Confidentiality</h3>
        <p class="">
            Questionnaires and computer logs are anonymous. Names of participants will be stored separately from
            information
            collected by a neutral third party from UBC Okanagan IT department, Olivier Dube. Therefore, the instructor
            of
            the
            course will not get access to participants' information until after the course appeal date. During this
            time,
            the
            instructor will only have access to anonymized version of your data. Information collected include all your
            electronically submitted programming work and associated marks (such as labs and assignments). Your name
            will
            not be
            associated in any way with the information collected about you or your usage of the computer during the
            study.
            Furthermore, because the interest of this study is to identify average responses and behavior of the entire
            group of
            participants, you will not be identified in any way in any written reports of this research.
        </p>
        <p class="">
            Participants have a right to access their own results so long as their names and numeric tags are still
            available.
            The data obtained from both components of the study will be retained for at least 5 years after publication
            in
            secured, electronic form, which only researchers associated with this research will have access to. No audio
            or
            video tapes will be used. General results of the research study may be available through publications. A
            summary
            of
            the results will be made available to participants upon request.
        </p>
