This for loop java tutorial will show you how to use for loops in java!

You can repeat code as many times as you want by using a for loop. For loops in java are just a block of code, that you can adjust to repeat what you want. In the first for loop in java example we repeated something very easy, ""I love dogs!"". Just replace that line with what you want and BOOM, you're done!

The name ""for loop"" can be a little tricky to get used to, but don't worry too much about it right now! They aren't too bad :) If you followed along, congrats! You learned-by-doing!

Nested loops in java are just a for loop inside a for loop. A common way to use nested loops in java is to get elements from a 2d array. To do that, your outer for loops takes care of the rows and your inner for loop takes care of the columns. 

Java loops can be VERY tricky, but don't worry too much about it right now! Use the code I provided and after time you'll get the hang of java loops :) If you followed along, congrats! You learned-by-doing!

This is Teja!
This video is going to be a Java Programming Video Tutorial.
In this video I will be teaching you about Looping in Java Programming.
Generally, a Loop statement is used to execute a group of statements or a single statement more than once, according to the need of a Programmer.
In Java, there are 3 types of loops and they are
1. For loop
2. While loop
3. Do-While loop
Watch the video for explanation on all the three types of loops.

This is the exact code to write while loops in java! ✅I show how to use them in your programs.

👑Start practicing now with 10 free java programs - http://alexlorenlee.com/
🌅 Source Code - https://github.com/alexlorenlee/JavaTutorialCode/blob/master/Loops/WhileDo.java

while(true) {

}

do {

} while(true);

These are the formats for how you create your while and do while loop in java. Now, you can replace ""true"" with an expression and whenever it's true, it will run the code in the curly braces.

These java while loops can be trick at first... But SURELY you'll get it :) If you followed along, congrats! You learned-by-doing!

4. Do not forget to ensure termination of loop

do while loop syntax:
do {
 statement-1;
 statement-2;
 :
 } while (condition);

do-while is exit controlled loop
1. Statements get executed first and then condition gets evaluated
2. If condition is false initially, loop will get executed once
3. Loop keeps executing till condition becomes false

break statement syntax:
 break;

1. Gets control out of the loop
2. Breaks out immediately
3. Control falls to statement after loop
4. Stops only the loop in which it resides

continue statement syntax:

 continue;

1. Immediately stops current iteration
2. Jumps to next iteration
3. Helps in ignoring certain iterations

We have continue statement  in java. The continue keyword can be used in any of the loops. It causes loop to immediately stop the current iteration and immediately jump to next iteration

int sum = 0;
for (int i = 1; i [= 100; i++) {
 if (i%2 == 0) {
  continue;
 }
 sum += i;
} 

# Program 1

public class BreakDemo {

 public static void main(String[] args) {
  
  String string = ""This is a long long string"";
  int numberOfOs = 0;
  for (int i=0; i[string.length(); i++) {
   if (string.charAt(i) == 'o') {
    numberOfOs++;
    System.out.println("" **** o found"");
    continue;
   }
   System.out.println(""This is not o"");
  }
  System.out.println(""Number of Os "" + numberOfOs);
 }
 
}


# Program 2
package com.training.java;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class WhileDemo {
  
 public static void printLine() {
  int numberOfAsterisks = 50;
  while (numberOfAsterisks ]= 0) {
   System.out.print(""*"");
   numberOfAsterisks--;
  }
  System.out.println();
 }
 
 public static void main(String[] args) {
  printLine();
  
  Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
  int input;
  do {
   System.out.print(""Enter a number (-1 to exit) : "");
   input = scanner.nextInt();
   if (input [= 0) {
    System.out.println(""Seems you are not interested !!"");
   }
   else if (input%2 == 0) {
    System.out.println(""You entered an even number"");
   }
   else {
    System.out.println(""You enetered an odd number"");
   }
  } while (input != -1);
  
  printLine();
 }

Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.

Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.

wbc7zf47Dhk,Java Tutorial 22 - Nested Loops in Java - Study Viral,"Java Tutorial 22 - Nested Loops in Java - Study Viral

When you ""nest"" two loops, the outer loop takes control of the number of complete repetitions of the inner loop. While all types of loops may be nested, the most commonly nested loops are for loops. Let's look at an example of nested loops at work.
