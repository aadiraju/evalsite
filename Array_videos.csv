Why learn Java?

Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented computer programming language that was designed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1995.

Key Highlights of Java:

Platform Independent: This allows programmers to develop applications that can run on any operating system.

Usability of Java: Java is most widely used programming language. It is present everywhere. It really doesn't matter which domain you are working in, you will surely come across Java sooner or later!

Open Source: The good news is that Java is available for free! All the development tools and the environment (JRE & JDK) that is used to develop Java applications are absolutely free of cost.

Android: Irrespective of the fact that you are tech savvy or not, most of us are badly bitten by the Android bug! Android is in great demand today and fortunately you need Java for Android development. Hence, the importance of Java has increased even more.

Hadoop: Hadoop is one of the most trending framework for processing Big Data. It has been designed and developed in Java.

In spite of having a tough competition on the server side from Microsoft and other companies, Java is doing extremely well on mobile platforms, thanks to Android! It has also been the primary language for Hadoop Developers.

2d arrays in java are nothing more than storing a table you can use for later. With it, you can take out whichever values you want, whenever you need them.

Arrays can be a little tricky if you're new to programming, but fear not! They aren't too bad :) If you followed along, congrats! You learned-by-doing!

This ArrayList in Java code will get your working code faster! ‚úÖThis is an ArrayList in java with examples.

Learn java in just 13 minutes: https://youtu.be/RRubcjpTkks

üåÖ Source Code - https://github.com/alexlorenlee/JavaTutorialCode/blob/master/Arrays/ArrayListProj.java

ArrayList fruitList = new ArrayList();

This is how you create your ArrayList in java. Now, you can type fruitList.add(), fruitList.get(), fruitList.clear(), fruitList.remove() and much more!

THESE are the main differences between the array in java and the arraylist in java. You can easily, add, remove and modify ArrayLists, but it's much harder with Arrays. That's the big difference between Arrays and ArrayLists in Java.

This ArrayList can be trick at first... But SURELY you'll get it :) If you followed along, congrats! You learned-by-doing!
