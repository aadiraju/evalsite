Selection Statements are basically of Five types:

1)if statement
2)if-else statement
3)if else if statement
4)nested if statement
5)switch case statement

if statement
--------------------------
An if the statement we have only if block if the condition is true then the block of code is executed or else it will skip the code.

if-else statement
-----------------------------
An if-else statement we have two blocks if and else, depending on the condition if it is true then the if block is executed or else it will skip the if block and execute the else block.

if else if statement
--------------------------------
An if else if statement we have three different types of blocks if, else if and else, depending on the condition if it is true then the if block is executed or else it will skip the if block and execute the next block of else if in the line,
if all the else if condition and also turned out to be false then else block will be executed

nested if
----------------------
When we have if block and within that, we have another if block then it's called as nested if

switch case
-----------------------
switch case statement basically check the choice that is given and matches it with the cases present within it, if choice match get the match 
then that case is executed if none of the case matches then finally default is executed

For beginners, here is exactly how to use java if and else if statements! ✅

👑Start practicing now with 10 free java programs - http://alexlorenlee.com/
🌅 Source Code - https://github.com/alexlorenlee/JavaTutorialCode/blob/master/Conditionals/IfElse.java

An if statement lets you decided which code to run under a certain condition. If a grade is between 90 and 100 then the letter grade is an A. Else if is just tacked on to specify another condition, like 80 to 90 is B, and so on. An else statement specifies code that's run for anything else! This was a pretty deep example for beginners but I hope it was helpful or gave you a template to start exploring if else statements in java on your own.

This is a template for how to do multiple java else if statements in java:
if() { 

 } else if () {

}  else if () {

} else {

}

This way of specifying how to run code with if statements can be a little tricky at first, but you'll surely get the hang of it! They aren't too bad :) If you followed along, congrats! You learned-by-doing!

I hope you enjoyed this tutorial on java else if statements tutorial! I like to have a nice mix of tutorials and actual projects for you all :)
